    "text": "This project provides valuable insights into how media outlets from different countries communicate economic policies, such as U.S. interest rates, using distinct linguistic styles and narratives. By identifying patterns in media coverage and clustering similar communication approaches, policymakers can better understand how information is framed and perceived internationally. This understanding can guide the development of more effective public communication strategies, ensuring key messages are accurately conveyed while minimizing potential misinterpretations. Additionally, this analysis can help identify biases or geopolitical influences in media reporting, which can inform policies aimed at fostering transparent and balanced global economic discourse.\n\n\nLimitations:\n\n\n\nThe current dataset includes only two media outlets due to limitations in public API availability. If central banks were able to collect news articles from a larger number of countries, they could gain a more comprehensive understanding of how the same policies are reported differently across various nations.\n\n\nThis analysis focuses only on the headline, snippet, and lead paragraph. If central banks could access the full articles, the clustering results would be more accurate."

    "text": "Methodology\nTo compare communication styles across media outlets from different countries, this study will employ the following data science methodologies:\n\nDimensionality Reduction Analysis: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be applied to reduce the complexity of the text data, focusing on key features from media outlets in various countries. This technique allows for comparisons based on a smaller subset of features that capture the greatest variance in communication styles. One example of PCA application that could serve as a reference involves researchers collecting text data from political debates and speeches. They extracted key linguistic features, such as sentiment, keyword frequency, and tone, and applied PCA to reduce the number of variables. This enabled them to identify underlying dimensions and map out how different political parties’ communication styles varied.\nClustering Analysis: After reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, clustering techniques such as k-means or hierarchical clustering will be used to group media outlets based on the similarities in their communication styles. This approach will help identify which countries or regions tend to adopt similar narrative patterns when discussing US interest rates, potentially reflecting geopolitical or economic alignment."

    "title": "A Comparative Analysis of US Interest Rate Communication Styles: Insights from Media Outlets Across Major Economies",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As one of the most critical issues of the 21st century, the COVID-19 pandemic was widely discussed for its public health threat during the pandemic era. In the post-pandemic era, however, the focus has shifted to its role in triggering a global financial crisis. Supply chain disruptions and shortages in goods and services have driven up prices, contributing to inflation in the post-pandemic era. Additionally, the Russia-Ukraine war has further intensified inflationary pressures, particularly by increasing energy and food costs.\nLike other major economies, the United States has not been immune to the financial challenges caused by both the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In response to these inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds Rate from 0.25% to 5.5% between March 17, 2022, and July 26, 2024. However, these prolonged high interest rates have had adverse effects on the global economy. Higher US interest rates have attracted both domestic and international investors, leading to capital outflows that can destabilize emerging markets by weakening their local currencies. At the same time, these rates have disrupted global trade: while countries dependent on exports may benefit from increased demand due to relatively cheaper prices for US consumers, the higher borrowing costs in the US significantly dampen consumer spending and investment.\n\nGiven these global economic ramifications, it is crucial to study how media outlets from different countries report and interpret US monetary policy. Understanding these cross-national media narratives can offer valuable insights for policymakers and investors, helping them better anticipate the potential impacts of US interest rate changes on foreign markets."
