    "title": "A Comparative Analysis of US Interest Rate Communication Styles: Insights from Media Outlets Across Major Economies",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As one of the most critical issues of the 21st century, the COVID-19 pandemic was widely discussed for its public health threat during the pandemic era. In the post-pandemic era, however, the focus has shifted to its role in triggering a global financial crisis. Supply chain disruptions and shortages in goods and services have driven up prices, contributing to inflation in the post-pandemic era. Additionally, the Russia-Ukraine war has further intensified inflationary pressures, particularly by increasing energy and food costs.\nLike other major economies, the United States has not been immune to the financial challenges caused by both the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In response to these inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds Rate from 0.25% to 5.5% between March 17, 2022, and July 26, 2024. However, these prolonged high interest rates have had adverse effects on the global economy. Higher US interest rates have attracted both domestic and international investors, leading to capital outflows that can destabilize emerging markets by weakening their local currencies. At the same time, these rates have disrupted global trade: while countries dependent on exports may benefit from increased demand due to relatively cheaper prices for US consumers, the higher borrowing costs in the US significantly dampen consumer spending and investment.\nGiven these global economic ramifications, it is crucial to study how media outlets from different countries report and interpret US monetary policy. Understanding these cross-national media narratives can offer valuable insights for policymakers and investors, helping them better anticipate the potential impacts of US interest rate changes on foreign markets."

    "text": "This study aims to collect data from media outlets in major economies such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, and Japan to facilitate a comprehensive comparison of communication styles regarding US monetary policy. However, due to limited access to some media outlets’ APIs, the study will focus on data from sources that offer free API subscriptions. At present, the available media outlets include The New York Times from the United States and The Guardian from the United Kingdom. While these sources provide valuable observations, they only represent two countries. Therefore, the next step of this study will be to explore additional media sources to gain more diverse insights into communication styles.\nThe current dataset consists of 1,000 observations, with 500 from The New York Times and 500 from The Guardian. The dataset includes the following features: headline, snippet, website url, and publication date. The visualizations below provide an overview of the “snippet” column for The Guardian data. Some key words like “inflation”, “interest rate” and “central ban” are frequently mentioned, which is consistent with searching plan. However, additional steps are required before applying data science methodologies, such as refining search filters to capture accurate mentions of US interest rates, capturing words representing emotions, expanding the stop words list to exclude irrelevant content, removing verb tenses, normalizing the data, and more."

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nTo compare communication styles across media outlets from different countries, this study will employ the following data science methodologies:\n\nDimensionality Reduction (PCA): Principal Component Analysis will be applied to reduce the complexity of the text data, focusing on key features from media outlets in various countries. This technique allows for comparisons based on a smaller subset of features that capture the greatest variance in communication styles. One example of PCA application that could serve as a reference involves researchers collecting text data from political debates and speeches. They extracted key linguistic features, such as sentiment, keyword frequency, and tone, and applied PCA to reduce the number of variables. This enabled them to identify underlying dimensions and map out how different political parties’ communication styles varied.\nClustering Analysis: After reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, clustering techniques such as k-means or hierarchical clustering will be used to group media outlets based on the similarities in their communication styles. This approach will help identify which countries or regions tend to adopt similar narrative patterns when discussing US interest rates, potentially reflecting geopolitical or economic alignment."
