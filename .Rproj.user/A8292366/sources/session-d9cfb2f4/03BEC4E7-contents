## Data

This study aims to collect data from media outlets in major economies to
facilitate a comprehensive comparison of communication styles regarding
US monetary policy. However, due to limited access to some media
outlets' APIs, the study will focus on data from sources that offer free
API subscriptions. The two media sources having publicly available API
are The New York Times and The Guardian; thus, this scope of this study
will be comparing the media communication styles between the Unites
States and the United Kingdom.

The current dataset consists of 500 observations, with 250 from The New
York Times and 250 from The Guardian. The dataset includes the following
features: `headline`, `snippet`, `leading paragraph`, `website url`,
`source`, and `publication date`.

## Methodology

To compare communication styles across media outlets from different
countries, this study will employ the following data science
methodologies:

-   **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**: Principal Component Analysis
    will be applied to reduce the complexity of the text data, focusing
    on key features from media outlets in various countries. This
    technique allows for comparisons based on a smaller subset of
    features that capture the greatest variance in communication styles.
    One example of PCA application that could serve as a reference
    involves researchers collecting text data from political debates and
    speeches. They extracted key linguistic features, such as sentiment,
    keyword frequency, and tone, and applied PCA to reduce the number of
    variables. This enabled them to identify underlying dimensions and
    map out how different political parties' communication styles
    varied.

-   **Clustering Analysis**: After reducing the dimensionality of the
    dataset, clustering techniques such as k-means or hierarchical
    clustering will be used to group media outlets based on the
    similarities in their communication styles. This approach will help
    identify which countries or regions tend to adopt similar narrative
    patterns when discussing US interest rates, potentially reflecting
    geopolitical or economic alignment.
