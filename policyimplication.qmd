title: "Policy Implication"

This project addresses the global implications of US monetary policy and helps policymakers and
investors understand different perspectives. By showcasing the PCA and clustering techniques, my
project not only extends the technical approaches covered in class but also bridges these methodologies
with practical implications in global policy and finance.
